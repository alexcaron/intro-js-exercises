The infinite loop is caused because the condition statement for the while loop uses the assignment operator (=) instead of the comparison operator (== or ===). The counter variable is reassigned to the value 1 each time the loop runs. This expression returns the value 1, which is truthy and therefore the loop is run again. Once inside the loop, the value is incremented by 1 to become 2 each time -- but since the value of counter is always reset to 1 by the condition statement, it never grows to be greater than 2. If it did, the break statement would end the loop. Otherwise, as is, the loop will run forever.
