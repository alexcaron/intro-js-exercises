This code is acceptable. The for loop has an initialization, condition, and an empty place for its incrementer statement. It still works though because the value of the increment increases in the body of the loop, meaning that eventually the value of i will become greater than 5 and the loop will stop.

In this case, the loop will print 1, then 2, then 3, then 4, then 5 before the value of i returns false (since i of 5 is not less than 5) and the loop will stop.
