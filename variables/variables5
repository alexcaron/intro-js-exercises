This program will log "bar" to the console. The strange situation here is that the second use of the variable name foo is a new declaration within a block (rather than just a reassignment of the value of the original foo variable). This is because the statement is "let foo = ..." and not just "foo = ..." Within that block, the "let foo" statement results in a new and different variable (also named foo) that only exists within that block. At the same time, the original foo variable still exists with its value "bar" outside of the block. So, the final line -- which is outside the scope of the block with the second let statement -- logs the original foo variable's value.
