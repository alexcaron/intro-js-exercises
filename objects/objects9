This should log "hi" and then "hello." This has to do with how function parameters work with objects (mutable) and strings (immutable). When the function bar(foo, qux) is called, the function's parameter variables point to the value of the two variables passed in. So both foo and argument1 (in the function call body) point to the same object {a: 'hello', b: 'world'}. And both qux and argument 2 (in the function call body) point to the same string 'hello.' When the argument1.a value is reassigned, the object itself is modified and so it is equivalent of modifying foo outside of the function body. The property of the original object is changed. But when argument2 is reassigned to 'hi', this just creates a new string and has the argument2 variable point to it (instead of the original 'hello' string). This doesn't change the fact that qux still points to 'hello.'
