No, the left and right variables in lines 10-12 are distinct from the ones in lines 1-2. In lines 1-2, they are parameters of the multiply function, and they only exist within the scope of the function. Even though they use the same name, the left and right variables declared in lines 10 and 11 are different, and they have global scope. In line 12, their values are passed in as arguments to the function, so there is another point of overlap in addition to their shared names with the parameters left and right of lines 1-2.
