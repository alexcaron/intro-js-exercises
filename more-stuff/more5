This function first creates an array of strings split at any spaces in the original string (e.g., "Hello my friend" becomes ["Hello", "my", "friend"]. Then the array is reversed, so the last index becomes the first, etc. (e.g., "friend", "my", "Hello"). And finally the reversed array is mapped to a new array that contains the length of each string in the original array (e.g., [6, 2, 5]).
